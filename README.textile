h1. Watir Tests

This repository contains some tests to show how automate your tests using the awesome Watir.

h2. What are we testing?

For now, we are testing Twitter. More precisely, the tweet feature.

h2. Installation

Clone the repository:

pre. git clone git@github.com:FabricioFFC/watir_tests.git

We are using bundler to manage our gems. So, you need to install it:

pre. gem install bundler

After install bundler, run 'bundle install' to install Watir and Rspec:

pre. bundle install

To run the tests:

pre. rspec spec/twitter/home_page_spec.rb

That's all. Enjoy! ;)

h2. Support

If you have some issue with the tests or how run it, search in Google first, and after you can open an issue in project's Github page.

For more information about how the project was built, you can access my blog "QualidadeBR":http://qualidadebr.wordpress.com/tag/watir/ (sorry, only Portuguese posts)
